# Graph-Analyzer
## Introduction
Graph Analyzer is a robust C++ program designed to read files containing graph edges and construct an adjacency list data structure. Utilizing efficient data structures like vectors and linked lists, this project offers functionality to analyze and comprehend various properties of graphs.

## Features

### Graph Construction
- Reads a file containing pairs of graph edges.
- Constructs an adjacency list using vectors and linked lists.

### Graph Analysis
- Calculates key graph statistics, such as:
  - Total number of nodes.
  - Total number of edges.
  - Maximum degree.

### Versatility
- Designed to handle a wide range of input scenarios, accommodating various graph structures.

### Efficiency
- Utilizes advanced C++ programming techniques to ensure optimal performance.

## Usage
The Graph Analyzer is primarily intended for educational purposes and research in graph theory. It serves as a handy tool for those studying the characteristics of different types of graphs and seeking to understand their underlying properties.

## Requirements
- A modern C++ compiler supporting C++11 or higher.
- Input files containing edge data in the prescribed format.

## Instructions
1. Compile the C++ program using your preferred C++ compiler.
2. Provide the input file containing the graph edges in the expected format.
3. Run the program to analyze the graph and display the calculated statistics.
4. Results can be further analyzed or exported as needed.
